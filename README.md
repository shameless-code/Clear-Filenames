# Clear Filenames

## Goal of the project
It is a simple project to showcase my basic understanding of Python. 
## What the project does
Cleans up filenames by replacing certain positions or substrings in the name based on the criteria provided in "symbols_to_replace.json".
Feel free to adjust the content of "symbols_to_replace.json" to your heart content.
## Requirements
The script is compatible with Python 3 and does not require any additional libraries.
